# Vitruvio - CityEngine Plugin for Unreal Engine 4

Vitruvio allows the execution of Esri CityEngine *rules* within Unreal Engine 4. Therefore, an artist does not have to leave their familiar Unreal toolset anymore to make use of CityEngineâ€™s procedural modeling power.

Vitruvio requires rule packages (RPK) as input which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style.

## Windows Development Setup

1. Checkout the code via `git clone https://devtopia.esri.com/Zurich-R-D-Center/vitruvio.git`
2. Create a new Unreal project (called host project from now on)
3. Create a folder named *Plugins* in the root directory of the host project
4. Start PowerShell as administrator
5. Create a symbolic link from the vitruvio repo to a folder named Vitruvio in the *Plugins* folder of the host project. Using the `New-Item` command. For example: `New-Item -Path "C:\dev\Epic Games\Unreal Projects\VitruvioHost\Plugins\Vitruvio" -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value "C:\dev\git\vitruvio\Vitruvio"`
6. Right click the uproject file of your Host project and run Generate Visual Studio project files. This will download the PRT library and setup the project. **Note** this might take a while.
7. After the project files have been generated the project can be opened.
