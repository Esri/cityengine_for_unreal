## Development Setup

1. Checkout the code via `git clone https://devtopia.esri.com/Zurich-R-D-Center/vitruvio.git`
2. For convenience the repository contains an project called *VitruvioHost* which contains the actual Vitruvio Plugin in the *Plugins* folder
6. Navigate to the *VitruvioHost* folder in your checked out repository
4. Right click the *VitruvioHost.uproject* file and run *Generate Visual Studio project files*. This will download the PRT library and setup the project. **Note** this might take a while.
5. After the project files have been generated the project can be opened
