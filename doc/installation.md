# Vitruvio Installation

This page describes how to install the Vitruvio Plugin for Unreal 4.26.

## Download

* Download the [latest Vitruvio](https://github.com/Esri/vitruvio/releases/download/v1.0.1/vitruvio-1.0.1-ue4.26-win10-prt2.3.6821.zip) version. **Note** that the zip file contains libraries which are used by Vitruvio and your browser might warn you not to download them. This warning can be ignored.

* Unzip the downloaded file and copy the extracted Vitruvio folder to `<Path to Unreal Engine 4.26>\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace`  (for example `C:\dev\Epic Games\UE_4.26\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace`). The Marketplace folder should now contain the Vitruvio Plugin folder.

## Installation

* Create a new Unreal Engine 4.26 project from the Epic Games launcher or open an existing project.

* After opening the project a popup will notify you of the newly available Vitruvio Plugin. Open **Manage Plugins...** (if the popup does not appear open **Edit** &rarr;Â **Plugins** instead)
